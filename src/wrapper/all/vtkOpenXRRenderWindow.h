/**
 * @class   vtkOpenXRRenderWindow
 * @brief   OpenXR rendering window
 *
 *
 * vtkOpenXRRenderWindow is a concrete implementation of the abstract
 * class vtkRenderWindow.
 *
 * This class and its similar classes are designed to be drop in
 * replacements for VTK. If you link to this module and turn on
 * the CMake option VTK_OPENXR_OBJECT_FACTORY, the object
 * factory mechanism should replace the core rendering classes such as
 * RenderWindow with OpenXR specialized versions. The goal is for VTK
 * programs to be able to use the OpenXR library with little to no
 * changes.
 *
 * This class handles the bulk of interfacing to OpenXR. It supports one
 * renderer currently. The renderer is assumed to cover the entire window
 * which is what makes sense to VR. Overlay renderers can probably be
 * made to work with this but consider how overlays will appear in a
 * HMD if they do not track the viewpoint etc.
 *
 * OpenXR provides HMD and controller positions in "Physical" coordinate
 * system.
 * Origin: user's eye position at the time of calibration.
 * Axis directions: x = user's right; y = user's up; z = user's back.
 * Unit: meter.
 *
 * Renderer shows actors in World coordinate system. Transformation between
 * Physical and World coordinate systems is defined by PhysicalToWorldMatrix.
 * This matrix determines the user's position and orientation in the rendered
 * scene and scaling (magnification) of rendered actors.
 *
